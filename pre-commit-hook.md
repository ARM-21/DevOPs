A pre-commit-hook is a script that runs automatically before a commit is finalized. It helps ensure code quality and consistency by checking for issues such as formatting errors, linting problems, or other predefined criteria. If the pre-commit hook fails, the commit is aborted, allowing developers to fix issues before pushing changes to the repository.

lint -> to check the code quality, syntax, formatting, and other issues in the codebase.
security test -> to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
unit test -> to run automated tests on the code to ensure it behaves as expected.
